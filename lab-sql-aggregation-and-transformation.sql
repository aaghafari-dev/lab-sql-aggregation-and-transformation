# Challenge 1
## 1. You need to use SQL built-in functions to gain insights relating to the duration of movies:
	### 1.1 Determine the shortest and longest movie durations and name the values as max_duration and min_duration.
SELECT
    MAX(length) AS max_duration,
    MIN(length) AS min_duration
FROM film;

### 1.2 Express the average movie duration in hours and minutes. Don't use decimals.
SELECT
CONCAT(FLOOR(AVG(length) / 60), ' hours ', ROUND(AVG(length) % 60), ' minutes ') AS Avarage_Duration
FROM film;


## 2. you need to gain insights related to rental dates:
### 2.1 Calculate the number of days that the company has been operating.
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MAX(rental_date), MIN(rental_date)) AS operating_days
FROM rental;

### 2.2 RRetrieve rental information and add two additional columns to show the **month and weekday of the rental**. Return 20 rows of results.

SELECT
    rental_id,
    rental_date,
    MONTHNAME(rental_date) AS rental_month,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS rental_weekday
FROM rental
LIMIT 20;
### 2.3 BONUS: Retrieve rental information and add an additional column called `DAY_TYPE` with values **'weekend' or 'workday'**, depending on the day of the week.
SELECT
    rental_id,
    rental_date,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS rental_weekday,
    CASE
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(rental_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 'weekend'
        ELSE 'workday'
    END AS DAY_TYPE
FROM rental
LIMIT 20;
## 3. You need to ensure that customers can easily access information about the movie collection. To achieve this, retrieve the **film titles and their rental duration**. If any rental duration value is **NULL, replace** it with the string **'Not Available'**. Sort the results of the film title in ascending order.
SELECT
    title,
    IFNULL(rental_duration, 'Not Available') AS rental_duration
FROM film
ORDER BY title ASC;

## 4. BONUS: The marketing team for the movie rental company now needs to create a personalized email campaign for customers. To achieve this, you need to retrieve the **concatenated first and last names of customers**, along with the **first 3 characters of their email** address, so that you can address them by their first name and use their email address to send personalized recommendations. The results should be ordered by last name in ascending order to make it easier to use the data.
SELECT
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    SUBSTRING(email, 1, 3) AS email_prefix
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

# Challenge 2: Next, you need to analyze the films in the collection to gain some more insights. Using the `film` table, determine:
## 1. 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film;
### 1.2 The **number of films for each rating
SELECT
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS film_count
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;
### 1.3The **number of films for each rating, sorting** the results in descending order of the number of films.
SELECT
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS film_count
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY film_count DESC;
## 2. Using the `film` table, determine:

### 2.1 The **mean film duration for each rating**, and sort the results in descending order of the mean duration. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places. This will help identify popular movie lengths for each category.
SELECT
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;
### 2.2 Identify **which ratings have a mean duration of over two hours** in order to help select films for customers who prefer longer movies.

SELECT
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING AVG(length) > 120;
## 3. : determine which last names are not repeated in the table `actor`.
SELECT last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
